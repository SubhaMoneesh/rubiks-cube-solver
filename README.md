# Rubik's Cube solver - using Korf's IDA* Algorithm | C++


This project features a Rubik’s Cube (3x3) modeled in C++ with a strong focus on Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and clean design. It demonstrates algorithmic problem-solving through multiple search strategies—including BFS, DFS, and IDDFS—achieving solutions for cubes scrambled 8 times in just 3 seconds. To tackle more complex scrambles, Korf’s IDA* algorithm was implemented with advanced heuristics, enabling solutions for cubes scrambled 13 times in under 10 seconds. Heuristic functions such as Manhattan distance and Pattern Databases were integrated, resulting in substantial improvements in computational efficiency and performance.
